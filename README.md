# CSCE-670-Playlist-Recommender-System

In this project we have implemented an ensembled approach to
build a song recommender system. For a given user, we try to
recommend a playlist to the user in the order of expected preference.
We do this by using the principles of song popularity, user to user
similarity, neural methods, and Bayesian Personalized Ranking. For
our recommendation system, we use implicit information retrieved
using song listen count for a user-song pair
